# University C Programs Repository
This repository contains a collection of C programs that were part of my university curriculum during the first semester.
As a practice and to reinforce my programming skills, I've also included Python implementations of these programs, which I learned in high school.

## Introduction
In my first semester at university, I learned and implemented a variety of C programs that covered fundamental concepts in programming. 
This repository serves as a reference and resource for those interested in understanding basic programming concepts through C.


## Programs
The repository includes programs covering topics such as:
- **Control Structures:** If-else statements, loops, switch-case, etc.
- **Functions:** Basic functions, recursive functions, function pointers, etc.
- **Arrays and Strings:** Manipulating arrays, working with strings, etc.
- **Pointers:** Understanding and using pointers in C.
- **Structures and File Handling:** Dealing with structures and file I/O operations.

Each program is well-commented, explaining the purpose of the program and key concepts used.


## Usage
You can explore each program individually by navigating to the corresponding directory. Both C and Python implementations are provided for comparison. If you are interested in a specific topic, feel free to browse the relevant folders.
To run the C programs, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC). For Python programs, use a Python interpreter (Python 3 recommended).


## Contributing
If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add more programs, contributions are welcome! Please follow the contribution guidelines.


Happy coding!
